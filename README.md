Task 2: Fill up the Circles (5 marks)

Write a GUI program to fill up three circles with appropriate colours. The circles should appear vertically within the window as shown in the images below. When the program first starts then the circles in the GUI should not be filled up by any of three colours as shown below. 



Only one colour (i.e. red, yellow or green) should be shown at a time based on the selection of a radio button at the bottom of the window.  Note that, the property binding of JavaFx needs to be implemented properly.
